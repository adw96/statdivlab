# prospective

Want to join or collaborate with the Stat Div Lab? Great! Here's what you need to know. I prioritise meeting and responding to my current trainees and collaborators first, so please be patient with me if I do not respond to you immediately. Feel free to send a gentle reminder if I haven't responded within 1 weeks (2 weeks for more complex enquiries).

### If you are a graduate student at UW...

- in Biostatistics or Statistics
   - You're welcome to email me to make an appointment to discuss potential projects. I'm in my office most days, so feel free to drop by.
   - I will be especially excited to work with you if you have any opinions about work that you find interesting. I don't expect students to come in with a formed idea of their first project, of course! "I read X paper and I would like to do something related" is a great start.
- in another department
   - I probably can't chair your graduate committee
   - If you want my input on how to analyse your data, email me to discuss being on your graduate committee
   - If you want my input on how to analyse your data, I cannot act as your GSR

### If you are in the Seattle area and want a consulting appointment

   - I will do my best to make time to meet with you, but please keep in mind that I receive many requests for consulting. I ask for your patience with me if my next appointment slot is not available for a number of weeks
   - I generally attend [Microbiome Club](https://cmistuw.org/microbiome-club/), so if you would like to talk to me about your analysis, your best bet is to attend and talk with me afterwards

### If you are not a graduate student at UW

- If we work in related disciplines and you have a question about my software or papers, I will try to get back to within a week.
- **I cannot help you with the admissions process to UW.** I receive many emails from students who applying to our program. I wish you the best of luck with your application and I apologise that I cannot respond to you individually.


### Other

I absolutely loathe emails, but I'm generally quite pleasant to interact with in person, so [Microbiome Club](https://cmistuw.org/microbiome-club/) is a great way to introduce yourself to me. I love hearing about new science, and I look forward to learning about your project!
