# reviewing

Reviewing papers is a wonderful way to advance science and direct the future of the field. If you're in the Stat Div Lab, I may ask you to review papers either with or for me. You should check back here about how to do this.

Your first review will be with me. I will review the paper and write my report (without reading your report), then read your report and compile our reports to return to the journal. We will then schedule a follow-up meeting to talk about your review. This last part is to help you develop as a scientist and as a reviewer. I always tell the journal that a student and I reviewed it together, and I encourage you to note on your CV that you reviewed for Journal X.

Here's what you should do when you receive your *first* review request from me.


- Read the title and abstract of the paper, and consider the date by which I asked for a response. If you don't have *at least* 6 hours to devote to carefully reviewing this paper, tell me straight away.
- Read Jeff Leek's to reviewing: https://github.com/jtleek/reviews. It gives a wonderful overview of the peer review process and expectations of you as a reviewer.
- Write your review, and return it to me by the date that I asked. If you've never reviewed before, I recommend following the below process for doing so.

## How I review papers

You may want to follow these steps if you have never reviewed before.

- I block out at least 4-6 hours on my calendar for each paper I review (if I have to check technical mathematical details of proofs, I put aside ~20). I may submit reviews on the day they are due, but I never submit reviews late. It's a capital vice to submit reviews late.
- I read the paper through once (relatively quickly) without touching a pencil. I then put the paper away and make some notes of my first impressions of it. I wait a day or two to let it simmer in the back of my mind (e.g., I reflect on it during my commute).
- I then read it again, this time making notes for myself, and starting to highlight important themes of the paper, along with things that I don't understand. If I wrote down some glaring issues after the first reading, I note the page and line number on which they are apparent. I type out a informal list of pros and cons of the paper.
- I go back through and try to resolve anything I didn't understand based on the second reading. I try to take care with this, because lack of transparency and details is a common reason why I recommend against publication. Recommending against publication is a serious decision to be making about someone's work, and I try to make absolutely sure that I understand the paper before making this decision.
- I evaluate my list of pros and cons of the paper, thinking about which cons are major versus minor concerns.
- Only now do I write my comments to the authors in the format of https://github.com/jtleek/reviews#structure-of-a-review
- I never try to find criticisms of a paper if none are apparent. Some papers are excellent and should be accepted without revisions. There is no reason to find something wrong with a paper to make yourself feel better or to seem like a serious reviewer.
- Unless the paper is plagiarised or the author has submitted a completely and utterly trivial paper for the sole reason of adding to their publication list (this is fortunately rare but I have seen it), I always articulate a few positive things about the paper. Examples include
    - The authors did an excellent job of clearly describing their method
    - The literature review is thorough and concise
    - The simulation study clearly demonstrates the advantages of their method
- If we are reviewing a paper together, I do not expect you to make a recommendation regarding the publication of the paper.

**Important**: the authors, title, and content of a paper given to you to peer review, either by me or by a editor, is completely confidential. Do not contact an author this paper you are reviewing, or discuss the content of the paper under review at conferences. If the paper is available as a preprint, you're welcome to discuss the paper with colleagues, but your role as a reviewer is confidential.

When I feel you are a strong reviewer, I will begin recommending you as a reviewer to journals, so they can contact you directly to invite you to review.
