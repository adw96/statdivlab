# coding

How I want you write and distribute code while in the Stat Div Lab -- coming soon

As the Stat Div Lab grows, I will fill out this section. For now, here's a brief overview of what I expect of your coding

- You attribute code authorship honourably
- If you submit a paper proposing a statistical method, the code is publicly available
- You code in R (preferred but optional)
